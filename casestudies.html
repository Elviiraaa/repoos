          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>
            In this project a parent cooperative called Småtrollens
            föräldrarkooperativ wanted a new design for their website. They
            wanted a website that reflected them as organisation, which was
            warmth, playfulness and their enviornmental focus. In this project
            we kept on working agile in our team.

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of designing a new website for Småtrollen was to attract
            additional families to the cooperative. Since the children enrolled
            in the cooperative were mainly siblings and getting older, the need
            for more families arose.

        <h2>Heuristic evaulation</h2>
        <p>
          A heuristic evaluation is a usability evaluation method used to
          identify usability issues in a user interface design. It involves
          having usability experts or evaluators review a user interface based
          on a set of predefined heuristics or guidelines, such as visibility of
          system status, user control and freedom, and error prevention.We chose
          four different heuristics that we felt matched with the clients needs,
          theese heuristics we then evaluated. This helped us identify the
          websites flaws and brought us ideas on what improvments we wanted to
          implement in our design. Our Heuristic findings

          <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
          <p>
            We were given material from Småtrollens föräldrarkooperativ, such as
            information text, pictures, fonts and colors that they liked. They
            also informed us about their organization and what feeling they
            wanted to be delivered through the website. With this information we
            then started brainstorming by doing low-fidelity wireframes with pen
            and paper. With all of our different ideas we created a mindmap with
            all the content that the website was going to contain. We created
            the structure of the website, based on the heuristics we had chosen
            and gestalt principles.

        <article>
          <h3>Wireframing</h3>
          <p>
            We created mid-fidelity wireframes to gain a clearer vision of how
            to construct the website, which also saved us time as it is simpler
            to implement changes in a wireframe than in a prototype.

        <article>
          <h3>UX-copy</h3>
          <p>
            From our heursitic evaluation we found their text on the existing
            website to be reiterative and too long. As a result, we chose to
            rewrite and shorten down the information text.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Colors and fonts</h3>
          <p>
            We selected the colors that Småtrollen had wished for. They embody
            their organization's values of warmth, playfulness, and a connection
            to nature. The fontstyles we chose are well-known and easy-to-read
            fonts that have stood the test of time and are beloved.

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            We created a libary with components, fonts and colorstyles and
            started to creat our high-fidelity prototype. Since we had our
            mid-fidelity wireframes it made it easy for us to change the
            wireframes into prototypes.

        <h3>In Progress</h3>
        <p>
          Småtrollen selected our team's design and another team's design from
          our class to be implemented on their website. Currently, we are in the
          process of designing the final user interface for their website.

        <h3>What I've learned</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A heuristic evaluation can help to improve the overall user
            experience of a product, by identifying usability issues and
            addressing them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making fast decisions can be challenging. Working with a short
            amount of time forces you to make fast decisions, which is not
            always simple.
          </li>
          <li>
            I gained experience in communicating with a client to understand
            their needs and preferences. This can helped me develop stronger
            client management skills.
